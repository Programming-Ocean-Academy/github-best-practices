# ✅ Ultimate GitHub Best Practices Guide

> A complete and professional checklist for creating, managing, committing, uploading, and collaborating on GitHub repositories — the right way.

---

## 🔧 1. Repository Creation

- ✅ Use a **clear and descriptive repo name** (e.g., `invoice-tracker`, `ai-research-pipeline`)
- ✅ Initialize with a `README.md`:
  - What the project does
  - Why it exists
  - How to use it
- ✅ Add a `LICENSE` — use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
- ✅ Create and configure `.gitignore` BEFORE your first commit
- ✅ Enable **Issues** and **Discussions** (for public repos)
- ✅ Use repo **topics/tags** for discoverability
- ✅ Add a useful project **description** and **homepage URL**

---

## 📂 2. Repository Structure

- ✅ Use a **logical folder structure**:


/src
/tests
/docs
.env.example
.gitignore
README.md

- ✅ Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide collaborators
- ✅ Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- ✅ Create an `.env.example` instead of committing real secrets
- ✅ Add documentation to a `/docs` directory

---

## 📥 3. Committing Code

- ✅ **Commit early, commit often**
- ✅ Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for consistency:

feat: add user registration
fix: correct typo in login logic
docs: update README


- ✅ Write clear, multi-line commit messages:

feature/signup-form
bugfix/crash-on-login
hotfix/payment-gateway

- ✅ Always `pull` before pushing
- ✅ Merge via **Pull Requests (PRs)** — no direct pushes to `main`
- ✅ Use **branch naming conventions**

---

## 🧠 5. Using GitHub Effectively

- ✅ Use **Pull Requests** with:
- Clear title
- Description (what, why, how tested)
- Linked issues (`Fixes #23`)
- ✅ Enable **GitHub Actions** for:
- Linting
- Tests
- Deployments
- ✅ Add PR templates:

.github/pull_request_template.md

- ✅ Track issues with labels:
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`
- ✅ Use GitHub Projects for kanban/roadmaps
- ✅ Protect important branches:
- Require PR reviews and CI checks

---

## 📦 6. Git Best Practices

- ✅ Avoid rewriting public history (`git push --force`)
- ✅ Use `git stash` when switching tasks
- ✅ Use annotated tags for releases:


git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Add report export feature"

- ✅ Squash commits before merging (optional)
- ✅ Rebase local branches instead of merging:

git pull --rebase


---

## 🔐 7. Secrets & Security

- ✅ NEVER commit secrets or `.env` files
- ✅ Use [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or `dotenv-linter`
- ✅ Enable **GitHub Secret Scanning**
- ✅ Use **SSH keys** or **PATs (Personal Access Tokens)**
- ✅ Enable **2FA** on your GitHub account
- ✅ Normalize line endings with `.gitattributes`

---

## 👥 8. Collaboration & Open Source

- ✅ Be polite and constructive in Issues/PRs
- ✅ Add contributors list in README or use [`all-contributors`](https://allcontributors.org/)
- ✅ Respond quickly to community feedback
- ✅ Use consistent labels and milestones
- ✅ Maintain a good **onboarding experience** for contributors

---

## 📊 9. Documentation & Maintenance

- ✅ Keep `README.md` up to date:
- Current features
- Known issues
- Running & testing instructions
- ✅ Add status **badges**:
- ![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)
- ![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-blue)
- ✅ Create a `CHANGELOG.md` (use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/))
- ✅ Archive stale repositories with notes
- ✅ Use GitHub **Insights** for contributions, forks, views

---

## 🔄 10. Automation, Hooks & Templates

- ✅ Use Git hooks with [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) or `pre-commit`
- Pre-commit linting, formatting, tests
- ✅ Add `.editorconfig` to enforce code styles across IDEs
- ✅ Create **template repositories** for reusable project setups
- ✅ Use [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) for automation:


gh pr create
gh repo clone user/repo


---

## 🧠 Bonus: Dev Mindset

- 🧩 **Think Long-Term**  
Every commit is future-you’s debugging session

- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Think Team-Scale**  
Others will read your commit logs and code

- 🤖 **Automate Everything**  
If it's repeatable, script it

- 🔐 **Security First**  
Assume secrets can leak — build guardrails

# ⚙️ GitHub Action: Repo Quality Enforcement Pipeline

Add the following workflow file to enforce repository hygiene rules including linting, testing, commit message standards, and secret scanning.

## 📄 File: `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`

```yaml
name: 🔍 Repo Quality Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, trunk]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, trunk]

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    name: 🚦 Quality Gate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: ⬇️ Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: 🟢 Set Up Node.js (for JS/TS projects)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: 📦 Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: 🧹 Run Linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: 🧪 Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name: 🔐 Check for Secrets
        uses: secret-scanner/action@v1
        with:
          fail-on-detection: true

      - name: 🔤 Validate Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)
        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5
        with:
          configFile: commitlint.config.js

      - name: 🚫 Check for Ignored Files Committed
        run: |
          git check-ignore $(git ls-files) | tee .ignored
          if [ -s .ignored ]; then
            echo "❌ Files tracked by Git that should be ignored:"
            cat .ignored
            exit 1
          fi
📌 Project Requirements
commitlint.config.js
js
نسخ الكود
module.exports = { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };
package.json Scripts
json
نسخ الكود
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
✅ What This Pipeline Enforces
🔍 Linting and Tests must pass

🧠 Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits

🔐 Secrets must not be present

🚫 Git-tracked files that should be ignored are flagged

💡 Pro Tip:
Enable branch protection rules to require these checks to pass before merging. This keeps your main branch clean and stable.

```
