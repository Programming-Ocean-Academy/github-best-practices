#  Ultimate GitHub Best Practices Guide

> A complete and professional checklist for creating, managing, committing, uploading, and collaborating on GitHub repositories â€” the right way.

---

##  1. Repository Creation

-  Use a **clear and descriptive repo name** (e.g., `invoice-tracker`, `ai-research-pipeline`)
-  Initialize with a `README.md`:
  - What the project does
  - Why it exists
  - How to use it
-  Add a `LICENSE` â€” use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
-  Create and configure `.gitignore` BEFORE your first commit
-  Enable **Issues** and **Discussions** (for public repos)
-  Use repo **topics/tags** for discoverability
-  Add a useful project **description** and **homepage URL**

---

##  2. Repository Structure

- âœ… Use a **logical folder structure**:


/src
/tests
/docs
.env.example
.gitignore
README.md

-  Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to guide collaborators
-  Include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
-  Create an `.env.example` instead of committing real secrets
-  Add documentation to a `/docs` directory

---

##  3. Committing Code

-  **Commit early, commit often**
-  Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for consistency:

feat: add user registration
fix: correct typo in login logic
docs: update README


-  Write clear, multi-line commit messages:

feature/signup-form
bugfix/crash-on-login
hotfix/payment-gateway

-  Always `pull` before pushing
-  Merge via **Pull Requests (PRs)** â€” no direct pushes to `main`
-  Use **branch naming conventions**

---

##  5. Using GitHub Effectively

-  Use **Pull Requests** with:
- Clear title
- Description (what, why, how tested)
- Linked issues (`Fixes #23`)
-  Enable **GitHub Actions** for:
- Linting
- Tests
- Deployments
-  Add PR templates:

.github/pull_request_template.md

-  Track issues with labels:
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`
-  Use GitHub Projects for kanban/roadmaps
-  Protect important branches:
- Require PR reviews and CI checks

---

##  6. Git Best Practices

-  Avoid rewriting public history (`git push --force`)
-  Use `git stash` when switching tasks
-  Use annotated tags for releases:


git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Add report export feature"

-  Squash commits before merging (optional)
-  Rebase local branches instead of merging:

git pull --rebase


---

##  7. Secrets & Security

-  NEVER commit secrets or `.env` files
-  Use [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or `dotenv-linter`
-  Enable **GitHub Secret Scanning**
-  Use **SSH keys** or **PATs (Personal Access Tokens)**
-  Enable **2FA** on your GitHub account
-  Normalize line endings with `.gitattributes`

---

##  8. Collaboration & Open Source

-  Be polite and constructive in Issues/PRs
-  Add contributors list in README or use [`all-contributors`](https://allcontributors.org/)
-  Respond quickly to community feedback
-  Use consistent labels and milestones
-  Maintain a good **onboarding experience** for contributors

---

##  9. Documentation & Maintenance

-  Keep `README.md` up to date:
- Current features
- Known issues
- Running & testing instructions
-  Add status **badges**:
- ![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)
- ![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-blue)
-  Create a `CHANGELOG.md` (use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/))
-  Archive stale repositories with notes
-  Use GitHub **Insights** for contributions, forks, views

---

##  10. Automation, Hooks & Templates

-  Use Git hooks with [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) or `pre-commit`
- Pre-commit linting, formatting, tests
-  Add `.editorconfig` to enforce code styles across IDEs
-  Create **template repositories** for reusable project setups
-  Use [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) for automation:


gh pr create
gh repo clone user/repo


---

##  Bonus: Dev Mindset

-  **Think Long-Term**  
Every commit is future-youâ€™s debugging session

-  **Think Team-Scale**  
Others will read your commit logs and code

-  **Automate Everything**  
If it's repeatable, script it

-  **Security First**  
Assume secrets can leak â€” build guardrails

#  GitHub Action: Repo Quality Enforcement Pipeline

Add the following workflow file to enforce repository hygiene rules including linting, testing, commit message standards, and secret scanning.

##  File: `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`

```yaml
name:  Repo Quality Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, trunk]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, trunk]

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    name:  Quality Gate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name:  Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name:  Set Up Node.js (for JS/TS projects)
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name:  Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name:  Run Linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name:  Run Tests
        run: npm test

      - name:  Check for Secrets
        uses: secret-scanner/action@v1
        with:
          fail-on-detection: true

      - name:  Validate Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)
        uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5
        with:
          configFile: commitlint.config.js

      - name:  Check for Ignored Files Committed
        run: |
          git check-ignore $(git ls-files) | tee .ignored
          if [ -s .ignored ]; then
            echo " Files tracked by Git that should be ignored:"
            cat .ignored
            exit 1
          fi
 Project Requirements
commitlint.config.js
js

module.exports = { extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'] };
package.json Scripts
json

{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
 What This Pipeline Enforces
 Linting and Tests must pass

 Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits

 Secrets must not be present

 Git-tracked files that should be ignored are flagged

 Pro Tip:
Enable branch protection rules to require these checks to pass before merging. This keeps your main branch clean and stable.

```
